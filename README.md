# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information about the project

## What is Lex?
LEX (LazerEX) is a lightweight, open source frontend for reddit written in Go.

## Why create Lex?

Reddit can be very slow, and is very bloated, that's no secret. It was really annoying to either wait a super long time for a single post to load, or the UI freezing up for no apparent reason, these were just some of the issues that were common for me in every browser I tried (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc.) so, I decided to try to re-create it. I did try to re-create it previously, and named it Lazer, but that attempt failed miserably, and I decided to give it one last shot. And so LazerEX was created, which is a far superior version than the previous attempt.

Lex can use up to 60% less bandwidth, while keeping the same image/video quality

As for the UI, I went for the newer reddit redesign, but with a little tweaking.

## How do I use Lex?

Unfortunately, unlike other open source reddit frontends, **Lex does not provide a demo website**, and there is two ways to build/use Lex.

1. [Downloading a Binary and running it](#downloading-binaries)
2. [Building Lex yourself](#building-instructions)

## Is Lex Free to Use? Do I need to pay to use Lex?

**Lex is, and always will be open source, and free to use either commerically, and/or privately, for as long as the origin of the software is not misrepresented.**

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

## Building Instructions

The only requirement to build the project is [Go](https://go.dev/dl)

If Go is installed, run the following commands in your terminal
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/cmd777/lex.git
cd lex
cd src
go get -u
go build
```
and, you're pretty much done, all that's left to do is launch the built binary, and navigate to `localhost:9090/r/{subreddit}`

## Downloading Binaries

To install LEX via automatically built binaries, go to the [releases](https://github.com/cmd777/lex/releases/latest) tab, and download the appropriate zip for your OS + ARCH, and extract it.

- For 32 bit Windows machines, download `lex-windows.zip`, then launch lex-i386-windows.exe
- For 64 bit Windows machines, download `lex-windows.zip`, then launch lex-amd64-windows.exe

After launching, navigate to `localhost:9090/r/{subreddit}`, and you're done.

# üö© Bugs, Issues, and other Important Information

Lex is still in very early stages of development, a lot of features are missing, and it might be prone to bugs, such as text overflowing, gallery buttons acting weird, and more.

I try to fix most of the critical bugs before pushing any changes, but if you find a bug, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/cmd777/lex/issues) for it.

I also work on Lex in my free time as a hobby, so development may be slow, thank you for your patience!
